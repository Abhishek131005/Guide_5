Step 1: Read CSV operator (import dataset)

Step 2: Nominal to Numerical Operator
*Join "out" port of Read CSV to "exa" port of Nominal to Numerical*

Step 3: Normalize Operator
*Join "exa" of Nominal to Numerical to "exa" of Normalize* 

Step 4: k-means Clustering Operator (k=3)
*Join "exa" of Normalize to "exa" of k-means Clustering*

Step 5: Performance (Cluster Distance Performance)
*Join 1st "clu" of k-means Clustering to "clu" of Performance*
*Join 2nd "clu" of k-means Clustering to "exa" of Performance*
*Join "per" of Performance to "res"*
